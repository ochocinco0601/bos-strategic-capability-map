# Appendix Completeness Check Summary Table

## Purpose
This document provides a summary status table for all Strategic Tier Capability Appendices, verifying that each core capability has been addressed with a corresponding detailed appendix. It also outlines the process for performing a completeness audit to ensure all required documentation artifacts are present and meet consistency and clarity standards.

## Completeness Check Process Overview
The audit process is designed to:
- Confirm the existence of an appendix for each capability listed in the Strategic Capability Map.
- Validate the presence of all major content sections (Purpose, Capabilities, Ownership, Strategic Value, etc.).
- Cross-check for alignment with the original gap rationale provided during strategic tier mapping.
- Identify any new or implied capabilities not yet documented.
- Document any appendix that needs revision, clarification, or expansion.

## Output Format
The table below summarizes the current audit status of each capability:

| Capability                          | Appendix Created | Reviewed for Gaps | Comments                        |

| Business Playbook Generator         | ✅               | ✅                | Complete                        |

## Future Session Notes (For LLM Continuity)
Large Language Models (LLMs) operate as stateless contractors rather than employees—they do not retain memory across sessions. Therefore, this section provides grounding for future contributors or LLMs to pick up where this audit left off.

### Suggested Next Steps
1. **Line-by-Line Appendix Audit:**
   - For each appendix listed above, verify it includes the following sections:
     - Purpose
     - Capability Overview
     - Primary Capabilities
     - Strategic Value
     - Recommended Implementation Characteristics
     - Primary Ownership
     - Supporting Use Cases
     - Strategic Alignment
     - Gap Rationale

2. **Identify Implied or Undocumented Capabilities:**
   - During previous sessions, capabilities like `Telemetry Tagging Guidelines`, `Runbook Translator`, and `Observability Template Registry` were discussed or hinted at.
   - Evaluate whether these should be:
     - Added as standalone capabilities.
     - Integrated as sub-sections into existing appendices.

3. **Maintain Separation of Concerns:**
   - When expanding content, apply the pattern used during `Business Playbook` and `Service Registry` appendix development.
   - Be cautious not to overload one appendix with multiple distinct systems.

4. **Consider Appendix-to-Artifact Linkage:**
   - Future work could include diagrams or traceability views showing how appendices connect to real implementation artifacts (e.g., where the Alert Rule Generator outputs YAML sent to Git, or how the Business Playbook links to ServiceNow entries).

### Visualization Flags (for Future Enhancement)
Some appendices may benefit from dedicated visual aids. These annotations are not required for completeness but will improve comprehension, technical alignment, and stakeholder engagement. Future sessions may:
- Add a `Visualization Recommended?` column to the summary table.
- Include a `Visualization Notes` section at the end of each appendix.

#### Examples:
| Capability                      | Visualization Idea |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Alert Rule Generator           | Flow diagram: signal → template → rule → deployment |
| Dashboard Blueprint Generator  | Wireframe of dashboard layout showing mapped signals |
| Deployment Engine              | CI/CD flow for alert and dashboard release artifacts |
| Business Playbook Generator    | Swimlane diagram of trigger to decision logic |
| Service Registry Platform      | Entity-relationship diagram of service metadata |

Benefits:
- Enhances technical credibility and clarity.
- Aids executive communication through high-level visuals.
- Supports cross-functional teams with referenceable architecture.

### Contact for Re-anchoring
If this document is used in a new session, re-anchor the LLM by providing a copy of the full `Strategic Capability Map`, all appendix documents, and the BOS tier definitions.

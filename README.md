# Business Observability System (BOS) Documentation

Welcome to the documentation repository for the **Business Observability System (BOS)**.

This repository contains the foundational and strategic documentation for evolving our observability capabilities from purely technical monitoring to a **productized state** where observability is no longer mere infrastructure, but a **business tool that drives outcomes**. It supports **prioritization, risk decisions, and continuous improvement**. The BOS aims to provide a clear, business-aligned view of system health and performance, enabling faster incident resolution, better prioritization, and more informed decision-making. This strategic approach is built upon **observability-as-code principles**, integrating observability into **Agile delivery** and ensuring traceability from business intent to live monitoring infrastructure.

## üåü Our North Star

The primary evaluation lens for all capabilities within this system is:
**Can we determine the business impact when there is a production incident?**

## üöÄ Purpose of This Documentation

This documentation serves as the single source of truth for:

* Defining the strategic vision and delivery model for Business Observability.

* Detailing the core capabilities required to achieve this vision.

* Clarifying ownership, responsibilities, and interdependencies between teams.

* Providing deep-dive appendices for each strategic capability.

## üîó Interconnected Capabilities

The strategic tier comprises eight **interconnected capabilities**, each playing a vital role in transforming raw telemetry into actionable business insight. These capabilities work together to form a holistic and robust Business Observability System.

## Observability Delivery Model: Foundational → Aligned → Strategic

This model describes the evolution of observability capabilities from technical existence to business value creation. It maps directly to current state, near-term improvements, and long-term product vision.

---

### 1. **Foundational – “The Feature Exists”**

- Observability has been implemented, but:
  - It’s mostly technical (logs, metrics, traces)
  - Labels and signals are not business-aware
  - Value is limited to technical teams
- **Description:** We built the plumbing, but it’s not yet delivering *business* value.

> **Current State:** This is where the organization is now—telemetry exists, dashboards exist, but they’re disconnected from business purpose.

---

### 2. **Aligned – “The Feature Serves a Clear Use”**

- Observability has evolved:
  - Signals include *business labels* (e.g., transaction types, customer categories)
  - Flows and events are *interpretable* by operations or product teams
  - Monitoring ties to business outcomes in an ad hoc or partial way
- **Description:** We’ve started translating technical events into business-relevant views.

> **Observability 2.0:** This aligns with recent platform capabilities and improvements—business-labeled telemetry, more meaningful alerting, and decision-relevant dashboards.

---

### 3. **Strategic – “The Feature Drives Outcomes”**

- Observability is productized:
  - Designed *from the business flow outward*
  - Step-level signal design, KPI mapping, ownership clarity
  - Integrated into product management, incident response, and business risk visibility
- **Description:** Observability is no longer infrastructure—it’s a business tool.  
  It supports prioritization, risk decisions, and continuous improvement.

> **Your BOS Vision:** This tier goes beyond Observability 2.0—it’s a purpose-built system that makes business impact observable by design.

# Business Observability Requirements Appendix

## Purpose
This appendix defines the Business Observability Requirements in detail. It explains its function, structure, and role within the strategic tier of observability maturity. This system ensures the organization can systematically capture, manage, and reuse observability requirements aligned with business goals.

## Capability Overview
The **Business Observability Requirements** provides structured mechanisms for capturing detailed observability inputs for each flow, stage, and step of a business process. It is responsible for gathering stakeholder-aligned information that forms the foundation for downstream observability artifacts such as alerts, dashboards, and impact playbooks.

## Primary Capabilities
- **Guided Authoring Interface** for product and engineering team members to enter observability-relevant data.
- **Structured Input Fields** supporting business function, stakeholder needs, signals (business/process/system), target outcomes, KPIs, and context tags.
- **Template Engine** aligned with the Business Observability Step Template, enforcing consistency and completeness.
- **Ownership Attribution** that supports role-specific responsibilities (e.g., Product, Developer, Platform SRE).
- **Versioning and Revision History** to track updates and ensure traceability across changes.

## Strategic Value
- Creates a **system of record** for observability requirements.
- Drives **consistency** across all applications and teams.
- Facilitates **automation** of downstream deliverables (alert generation, dashboard templates, etc.).
- Enables **cross-team alignment** by formalizing expectations and inputs.
- Establishes a **single-source-of-truth** for what must be observed and why.

## Recommended Implementation Characteristics
- Should be implemented as a **user-facing application or interface** with support for both form-driven input and structured data export.
- Integrated with downstream components such as the **Alert Rule Generator**, **Dashboard Blueprint Generator**, and **Business Playbook Generator**.
- Capable of embedding into Agile workflows (e.g., acceptance criteria templates, PI planning artifacts).

## Capability Owner
- **Central SRE Team**: System design, authoring standardization, user enablement, and template governance.

## Adopting Teams
- **Product Team**: Input authorship and accountability for defining business-relevant observability context.
- **Development Team**: Participation in defining technical correlates of required business signals and reliability targets.

## Supporting Use Cases
- A product owner defines a new feature’s expected business behavior and associated failure risks.
- A developer maps telemetry data sources to required signals for reliability tracking.
- A Platform SRE reviews input to validate coverage before production readiness.

## Strategic Alignment
This system enables maturity progression by shifting observability from ad hoc or tribal knowledge to explicit, structured, and reusable intent. It is a cornerstone capability for the Strategic tier of observability maturity.

## Gap Analysis and Enhancement Recommendations

### 1. High Conceptual Depth: Flow/Stage/Step Metadata
**Gap:**
- Lacks explicit definitions for `flow`, `stage`, and `step`.
- Doesn’t describe semantic relationships or data model hierarchy.

**Recommendation:**
- Add a **Semantic Model Foundation** section to define these core structures.
- Clarify how this metadata underpins traceability, automation, and reuse.

### 2. Strong Risk of Misunderstood Ownership
**Gap:**
- Doesn't explain why ownership is often unclear.
- Doesn’t visualize where product, dev, and platform roles intersect.

**Recommendation:**
- Add **Clarifying Shared Ownership Boundaries** section.
- Include rationale for role attribution and examples of overlap zones.

### 3. System of Record for Downstream Artifacts
**Gap:**
- Mostly addressed, but can be emphasized more explicitly.

**Recommendation:**
- Add to **Strategic Value**: “This system precedes and governs the generation of all downstream artifacts such as alert rules, dashboard blueprints, deployment configs, and observability playbooks.”

### 4. Requires Clarity on Integration with Agile Workflows
**Gap:**
- References Agile workflows but lacks detail.

**Recommendation:**
- Expand Agile guidance with concrete integration points:
  - Supports story-level observability acceptance criteria.
  - Embedded during PI planning for step definition.
  - Used during sprint demos for signal validation and coverage checks.

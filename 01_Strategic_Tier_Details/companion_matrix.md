# Strategic Capability Companion Matrix

## Purpose
This matrix answers two foundational questions:
- **What do we need to make Business Observability real?**
- **Who is responsible for delivering it?**

It operationalizes the Strategic Tier capabilities by clarifying:
- Ownership per team
- Inputs and outputs
- Interdependencies
- Traceability to upstream requirements and downstream artifacts
- **Delivery commitments per team**

---

## Output Format
Each row in the matrix represents a Strategic Tier capability. Each column provides one dimension of execution or ownership.

## Notes
- **Ownership** reflects primary accountability, but most capabilities are cross-functional.
- **Dependencies** surface the architectural and workflow interlocks that require cross-team coordination.
- **Delivery Commitments** make explicit what each team must do to realize the capability.
- **Tier** focuses on **Strategic** for this version. Future versions may cover Tactical and Foundational tiers.

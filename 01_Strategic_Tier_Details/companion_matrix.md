# Strategic Capability Companion Matrix

## Purpose
This matrix answers two foundational questions:
- **What do we need to make Business Observability real?**
- **Who is responsible for delivering it?**

It operationalizes the Strategic Tier capabilities by clarifying:
- Ownership per team
- Key outputs and deliverables
- Interdependencies
- Traceability to upstream requirements and downstream artifacts
- **Adopting team responsibilities**

---

## Output Format
Each row in the matrix represents a Strategic Tier capability. Each column provides one dimension of execution or ownership.

| Capability | Capability Owner(s) | Key Outputs | Dependencies / Interfaces | Adopting Teams | BOS Tier Relevance |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Business Observability Requirements | `Central SRE Team` | Declarative requirement templates | Agile workflow tooling, dashboard generator, alert engine | `Product Team` defines BOS metadata; `Development Team` implements signals | Strategic |
| Service Registry Platform | `Central SRE Team` | Registry with versioned service details | BOS authoring, deployment traceability, ownership lookup | `Development Team`, `Product Team` register service records | Strategic |
| Business Playbook Generator | `Central SRE Team` | Playbooks linked to alerts and dashboards | Knowledgebase, incident workflow, observability system | `Product Team`, `Development Team`, `Platform SRE Team` provide inputs used to generate the playbooks | Strategic |
| Alert Rule Generator | `Central SRE Team` | YAML-based alert rules | Deployment engine, dashboards, telemetry tagging | `Development Team` maps signals to alert rules; `Platform SRE Team` provides generation templates | Strategic |
| Dashboard Blueprint Generator | `Central SRE Team` | Dashboard specification documents | Business requirements, alert engine | `Product Team` defines KPIs; `Development Team` translates into blueprint specs | Strategic |
| Alert & Dashboard Deployment Engine | `Central SRE Team` | Deployed alerts and dashboards | CICD pipeline, Git, API interfaces | `DevSecOps Tooling Team` automates and enforces deployment patterns | Strategic |
| Agile Integration Toolkit | `Central SRE Team` | Agile story injection, shared tracking | Jira, Agile platforms, BOS artifacts | `Product Team`, `Development Team`, `Platform SRE Team` uses for BOS-aligned story delivery | Strategic |
| Observability as Code & CICD | `Central SRE Team` + `DevSecOps Tooling Team` | Automated promotion + enforcement in pipeline | Deployment engine, GitOps, APM/monitoring tools | `Development Team` integrates into pipelines; `Central SRE Team` drives observability-as-code enforcement | Strategic |

---

## Notes
- **Ownership** reflects primary accountability, but most capabilities are cross-functional.
- **Dependencies** surface the architectural and workflow interlocks that require cross-team coordination.
- **Adopting Teams** make explicit what each team must do to realize the capability.
- **Tier** focuses on **Strategic** for this version. Future versions may cover Tactical and Foundational tiers.

### Footnote on Team Labels
**DevSecOps Tooling Team**: Label represents the internal team responsible for managing CI/CD tooling, deployment automation, and GitOps enforcement. Common external labels include "Enterprise Platform Team" or "DevOps Enablement."

**Product Team**: Refers to business-aligned product owners and product managers.

**Development Team**: Refers to software engineers and developers responsible for delivering product functionality.

**Platform SRE Team**: Refers to teams focused on IT operations, service availability, and platform support functions.
